        <h1>[Game Title]</h2>
        <p>[Game Title] is a tile-based dungeon crawler created in Android Studio for Georgia Tech's CS 2340 class over a period of 5 months.
            We built the project over a period of 5 months making use of AGILE/SWIFT methodology, several object-oriented design patterns, and SOLID/GRASP principles. 
        </p>

        <h1>Design Patterns</h2>
        <p>In the development of [Game Title], we made use of a number of design patterns that we learned about in class. These patterns helped us to [list of benefits of using design patterns].</p>

        <p>Here are some specific examples of how we used design patterns in our game:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Singleton Pattern: We implemented this pattern so that there would be only one instance of the Leaderboard and Player at a time. 
                This ensured that we would always access the correct object and perserve changes across game states.</li>
            <li>Observer Pattern: This pattern was implemented so that objects can observe changes in the Player or RoomViewModel classes.
                For example, enemies that observe the player are notified whenever the player moves, prompting them to move as well.
            </li>
            <li>Strategy Pattern: The strategy pattern was used to create similar instances with similar but different functionalities.
                There are 2 movement strategies for the player based on keyboard or touch input, and 4 strategies for the different types of enemy movement.
            </li>
            <li>Factory Pattern: The factory pattern was used to easily instantiate different enemy types based on a designated input variable.
            </li>
            <li>Decorator Pattern: We used the decorator pattern to implement the different functionalities of powerups to ensure they would only affect the player.
            </li>
        </ul>
