        <p>Escape the dungeon! Fight monsters! Be a pixel guy! </p>
        <p>
            In [Game Title], you must choose between three characters to play as: an elf, a knight or wizard. You must traverse through each dungeon to reach the exit in the shortest amount of time.
            Along the way, you will encounter dangerous monsters you can defeat to increase your score. Beware, because touching these creatures could end your run!
            Powerful power ups lie hidden in plain sight. Acquire these to aid you in your quest to escape the dungeon! And fight monsters! And be a pixel guy!!
        </p>

        

        <h3>Development Process</h3>
        <p>[Game Title] is a tile-based dungeon crawler created in Android Studio for Georgia Tech's CS 2340 class.
            We built the project over a period of 5 months making use of AGILE/SWIFT methodology, several object-oriented design patterns, and SOLID/GRASP principles. 
        </p>

        <p>Our team faced a number of challenges during the development process, including issues with implementing a coordinate system and sprite rendering. 
            However, we were able to overcome these challenges by creating custom scripts for tilemap parsing and creating a grid system.</p>

        <p>[Game Title] features a number of unique features, including background music.</p>

    <section id="game-design-patterns">
        <h1>Design Patterns</h2>
        <p>In the development of [Game Title], we made use of a number of design patterns that we learned about in class. These patterns helped us to maintain low coupling, polymorphism, abstraction and other object-oriented principles in our code.</p>

        <p>Here are some specific examples of how we used design patterns in our game:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Singleton Pattern: We implemented this pattern so that there would be only one instance of the Leaderboard and Player at a time. 
                This ensured that we would always access the correct object and perserve changes across game states.</li>
            <li>Observer Pattern: This pattern was implemented so that objects can observe changes in the Player or RoomViewModel classes.
                For example, enemies that observe the player are notified whenever the player moves, prompting them to move as well.
            </li>
            <li>Strategy Pattern: The strategy pattern was used to create similar instances with similar but different functionalities.
                There are 2 movement strategies for the player based on keyboard or touch input, and 4 strategies for the different types of enemy movement.
            </li>
            <li>Factory Pattern: The factory pattern was used to easily instantiate different enemy types based on a designated input variable.
            </li>
            <li>Decorator Pattern: We used the decorator pattern to implement the different functionalities of powerups to ensure they would only affect the player.
            </li>
        </ul>
